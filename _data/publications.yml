        _Hybrid Ink_ is pleased to announce our inaugural publication of the novel *My Dinner with Andrea* by Jen Durbent, a story of love, hate, and, occasionally, tacos.
    # cover: ''
    synopsis: |
        Faith has started dating again - with the blessing of her wife - to find someone to connect with. Andrea seems to be a good match in many ways. The world is a difficult place for two trans women dating, but when you take into account neo-Nazis, a rapist, and some overzealous cops, it can feel downright impossible.

        I got a story for you about two women falling in love, of Andrea and Faith. That seems nice, doesn't it? A nice trans lesbian queer romance?

        Oh, and there's Faith's wife, Michelle, too.

        And transphobia and ablism. And overzealous cops, Nazis, and a rapist.

        Oh, but there's also video games, polyamory, and living visibly trans in a small American town. And tacos.

        Dear reader, I got a story for you.

                I found *My Dinner with Andrea* to be stunning. I see a lot of Faith in myself, and a lot of Andrea in who I want to be. It's an engaging and intimate work, and I'm proud to have it as the inaugural publication for _Hybrid Ink_.

                [*My Dinner with Andrea*] feels very personal, especially with the narrator's engagement. Very enjoyable!

        The famous writer is dying...

        Or so his students suspect.

        When the famous writer's secretary starts to get in touch with his old students, they all suspect something is up — perhaps cancer, or some vague heart condition — whether or not that's true.

        To that end, Allison, one of the writer's old students, begins organizing a reunion. One last get-together where all of the attendees of the Deep South Writers' Workshop from over the years can get together and reminisce.

        Trent, the true artist.

        Maya, the successful author.

        iMOL and Trisha A., the internet personalities.

        Authors, agents, coworkers, and loved ones.

        When, against all odds, the famous writer does die, the reunion turns into a memorial.

        A memorial, and one last workshop.
