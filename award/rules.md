## Category Restrictions

All categories require that a work be available in a public fashion (that is, anyone should be able to view, download, purchase, or otherwise access the content, with no limits on who[^signups]). Additionally, all categories are open to works created outside the fandom as well as in.

### Video category

Accessibility
:   The platform, publisher, or channel should be accessible in a public fashion. There is no restriction placed on distribution mechanism or medium. There is no date requirement, other than that the platform, publisher, or channel must be active at nomination time.

### Other category

Content
:   The award should nominate a work of non-fiction not otherwise covered. This may include a website, a hypertextual article or resource (which doesn't fit under the platform category), a game, a comic, etc. The sky's the limit on this one. However, it should retain a focus on the furry subculture.

Accessibility
:   The work should be accessible in a public fashion. There is no restriction placed on distribution mechanism, such as a distribution platform like itch.io, a publisher for things such as comics, or a website. The work should be dated, if possible.

[^signups]: Signing up to a website as a requirement to view a nomination doesn't count as a restriction; by this we mean that cases where only members of a group or organization are allowed to access the resource would be ineligible.

[^wordcount]: This is flexible and intended only as a guide, as the distinction between article and book is more a matter of the scope of content: an article (usually) explores a single facet of a single topic, whereas a book is far broader in scope, and may cover several related topics. Longer articles and shorter books will, of course, be considered.

[^platforms]:  This means the bit that does revolve around furry: yes, YouTube is a platform, but Culturally F'ed is the channel that is eligible). For a better example, an issue of <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> is eligible as a book (anthology type), an article in that issue is eligible as an article, but <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> is eligible as a platform, publisher, or channel.
