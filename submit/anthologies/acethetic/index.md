# Acethetic

Much of our art, be it written, visual, or otherwise, is based around sexual attraction and the desire for sexuality. Even in stories where the major plot is focused elsewhere, sexuality will often show up in a subplot.

Sexuality is hardly universal, however: though allosexuality may define the media landscape we live in, it does not define all of us!

This anthology is a place for ace characters to shine. Perhaps your character is striving for recognition against expectations placed on them by society. Perhaps they are simply trying to live a quiet life and meeting unexpected resistance. Either way, *Acethetic* exists for their stories to be heard.

## About the anthology

*Acethetic* is an anthology of short fiction edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and e-book formats, as well as, depending on interest, audiobook format.

Here is what {{site.brand}} is be looking for:

Submission content
:   We are looking for short story submissions that explore the lives of our asexual friends and family. The stories should focus on characters anywhere on the specturm of asexuality. Aromantic characters also welcome, of course! We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

Submission rating
:   G--R --- we ask that authors avoid explicit descriptions of sex, but do understand that sometimes that's necessary to the plot. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask!

Genre
:   While there is no restriction on genre of submitted stories, we will aim for a cohesive anthology after the fact. For instance, if we receive more speculative fiction stories than contemporary fiction, that may play a role in accepting stories. Literary fiction, speculative fiction, shifters, furries...give us your best!

Submission length
:   5,000--15,000 words --- if you feel like you will fall outside this range, let us know!

:   $25 flat rate per story.

Simultaneous submissions
:   Yes.

Multiple submissions:
