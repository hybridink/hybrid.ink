Here's all the fine print and rules. The award process involves four steps: jury selection, recommendation, nomination, and awarding. The process itself should take four months to complete.

## Jury Selection

* Jurors will be chosen from a pool of applicants and invitees and made public.
* The selection process will be made public and posted by the first of December.

## Recommendation

* Anyone may submit a recommendation for a non-fiction work in any of the above categories through a simple web form.
* An eligible work must have been published between the January first and December thirty-first of the award year.
* For entries that span years such as those in the platform, publisher, or channel category, each entry is only eligible to win the category once; after that, it is ineligible for entry.
* This process will take place from the first of December through the end of February.
* If a category gains fewer than three recommendations, there will be no award for the category.
* Anyone may recommend a work, even their own.

## Nomination

* After the recommendation period ends, the collected recommendations are provided to the jury for nomination.
* Voting takes place through a ranked voting system.
    * Each juror will receive five votes per category, ranked from one to five, where one is best.
    * The juror will nominate their top five picks from the category ranked in order.
    * The juror does not need to use all of their votes, or to vote within a category at all.
    * The jury votes will provide a winner and a runner-up for the category.
    * All jurors will be able to vote on all categories.
    * Jurors will not be able to vote on a category in which they have a nomination.
    * Jurors' votes will be visible only to them until the nomination process is completed.
* This process will take place from the first of March to the thirty-first of March. Jurors may not vote on their own works.

## Awarding

* On the first of April in a publicly viewable ceremony, the awards will be presented by a member of the jury or the <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> Awards Chair.
* All ranked nominations will be recognized, with the top ranked nomination winning the category.
* Ties are allowed.
* The award for the first year will be a certificate and recognition on [Hybrid](/){: class="brand" }.
