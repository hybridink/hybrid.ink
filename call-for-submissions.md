title: Call for Submissions
---

Submissions are currently closed, but below is provided our standard call for reference.

## Non-fiction
* 1000-5000 words - longer will be considered based on their merit
* Opinion or article
* 10-15 count
* We are looking for diverse nonfiction writing about the furry fandom, either opinion or articles, written in a clear, concise fashion.  Be prepared to show your sources if you cite them, to enter into intelligent discourse surrounding your topic, and to offer insight to other members of our fandom that you have uncovered through your work.  Submissions should fit the general theme of the volume to be published.
* To avoid getting a lot of similar articles, we encourage people to think outside of the box and be creative with their opinions. We don’t want 90% of what we get to all be the same type of article.
* An article being well written will certainly help, but we are also looking to give the reader diverse and interesting opinions. If somebody has difficulties expressing themselves, but we feel they have something genuinely interesting to say, we will be willing to work with them to bring that out. We do not want anyone’s point to lose it’s potency through an abundance of purple-prose.

## Poetry
* 6-7 count
* Looser guidelines on length, but should probably be 30-50 lines or ~1-2 pages
* We are looking for short works of poetry to add to the publication in order to both showcase the poets within our fandom as well as provide a change of pace from the non-fiction works.  Poems should still surround the idea of what it means to be a furry; although all poems will be considered, those which fit the theme of the volume to be published will receive priority.

## Theme
* Volume 1: Why are you a furry?  Why are others furries?  Where do we come from?  Reflections on what elements of socialisation led us to become the subculture that we are today.

## When
* (some date in the future)

## How
* Email
* Multiple submissions: yes, but one per email.  No more than 5 per category.
* Prior publishing allowed: yes - though original work will be given priority

## How much
* &frac12; cent/word for nonfiction, flat $20 for poetry
