John Minichillo's novel, *The First Woman on Mars* is forthcoming from Spaceboy Books. His novel, *The Snow Whale*, was an Independent Publishers Book Awards regional gold medalist for the West-Pacific and an Orion Magazine Book Prize notable. He wrote the column, "How to Be a Better Teacher-Person Through Apathy" at McSweeney's Internet Tendency as one of the winners of their column contest.

His science fiction novel, *EOB: Earth Out of Balance*, out now on Kindle Press, was described as 'one of the smartest, funniest, best-developed novels of any genre.'
