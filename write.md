title: Call for Submissions
---

Submissions are currently closed, but below is provided our standard call for reference.

## Non-fiction

We are looking for diverse nonfiction writing about the furry fandom, either opinion or articles, written in a clear, concise fashion. Be prepared to show your sources if you cite them, to enter into intelligent discourse surrounding your topic, and to offer insight to other members of our fandom that you have uncovered through your work. Submissions should fit the general theme of the volume to be published.

To avoid getting a lot of similar articles, we encourage people to think outside of the box and be creative with their opinions. We don’t want 90% of what we get to all be the same type of article. An article being well written will certainly help, but we are also looking to give the reader diverse and interesting opinions. If somebody has difficulties expressing themselves, but we feel they have something genuinely interesting to say, we will be willing to work with them to bring that out. We do not want anyone’s point to lose it’s potency through an abundance of purple-prose.

Wordcount
:   4,000-10,000 words --- longer or shorter submissions will be considered based on their merit

Prior publication
:   Allowed for unencumbered works or with publisher's express permission.

Multiple submissions
:   Allowed, with an author having no more than one third of the total word-count per issue.

Content
:   Opinion or article

Number per issue
:   5-10 count

Rate
:   &frac12; cent per word within budget[^budget].

## Poetry

We are looking for short works of poetry to add to the publication in order to both showcase the poets within our fandom as well as provide a change of pace from the non-fiction works. Poems should still surround furry as a subculture, a furry world, or life as an animal (anthropomorphic or otherwise). Although all poems will be considered, those which fit the theme of the volume to be published will receive priority.

Length
:   Up to 50 lines --- longer submissions will be considered based on their merit

Prior publication
:   Allowed for unencumbered works or with publisher's express permission.

Multiple submissions
:   Allowed, with a maximum of two poems published per issue per author.

Number per issue
:   3-5 count

Rate
:   Flat $10

## Theme

* {{site.brand}} 1, no. 1 --- Identities: Identity and Interest, Gender and Sexuality.  It's one thing to list *what* you are interested in, but it's another altogether to explore why.  How does furry play into your gender identity and sexual orientation?  How does it influence how you view yourself and the things that you enjoy?
* <span class="next-opening">{{site.brand}} 1, no. 2 --- Origins: Why are you a furry?  Why are others furries?  Where do we come from?  Reflections on what elements of socialisation led us to become the subculture that we are today.</span>
* <span class="not-yet-applicable">{{site.brand}} 2, no. 1 --- Creations: Creators and Creations.  What drives us as furries to create what we do, at the rate we do, and at the prices we charge?  What drives commissions, trends, and styles?  How does our participation in furry color the creator-creation relationship?</span>
* <span class="not-yet-applicable">{{site.brand}} 2, no. 2 --- Time: Past and Future.  Where did furry come from, and where is it going?  How fast are we moving, and how much are we staying the same?  Are our drives conservative or liberal, or if they're a mix, why is that the case?</span>

## When

{{site.brand}} Vol. 1 No. 1 will be open for submissions from **March 1, 2017** to **September 1, 2017**.

## Schedule

{{site.brand}} is released on a semiannual schedule. Issues come out on October 1st and April 1st, and open six months prior. The calls are open for five months, with one month dedicated to pulling together an issue. That means the schedule looks like such for each volume:

Issue No. 1
:  
    * *Open:* March 1
    * *Close:* September 1
    * *Release:* October 1

Issue No. 2
:  
    * *Open:* October 1
    * *Close:* March 1
    * *Release:* April 1

## How

Submitify link coming soon!

[^budget]: Submissions are budgeted by type. {{site.brand}} allocates $500 per issue to paying authors for non-fiction, and $50 to paying poets for poetry. This means that, if the non-fiction submissions wind up topping 100,000 words, payouts will be cut. As there will never be more than 10 non-fiction submissions per issue, this will have meant that a submission went over 10,000 words; that submission will be paid a max of $50. If a submission goes over 10,000 words and the total for non-fiction is less than 100,000 words, the author may be paid for their word count above and beyond 10,000 words. Our apologies for the confusion, but, as a non-profit publisher paying authors out of pocket, we must budget carefully.
