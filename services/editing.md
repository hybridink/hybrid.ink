Editing is as important a part of putting ones works out there as the writing itself. {{site.name}} offers four levels of editing for authors who do not intend to publish through our house. As all of these are highly dependent on the text, please email us for more information at <mailto:hybrid+editing@hybrid.ink>.

### Proofreading

The broadest scope of editing available is proofreading, which is simply a pass to ensure that a work is ready for publication with some broad-stroke comments on structure, content, style, and grammar without providing any fixes. This is the perfect last-step before publication, and the most affordable at prices as low as 0.5¢ per word with a minimum fee of $20.

*Current turn-around time is approximately two weeks.*

### Developmental editing

Developmental editing tackles the big-picture stuff. When it comes to writing, it can sometimes be useful to have another set of eyes on your work to help disentangle plot snarls, find places where the pacing is off, and sort out confusing language. At this high-level overview, you can expect to pay as low as 0.7¢ per word with a minimum fee of $35.

*Current turn-around time is approximately three weeks.*

### Copy editing

If you simply need someone to go over you text with a fine-toothed comb for spelling and grammar errors, we're happy to work with you to get your text cleaned up and ready to go. This level of nitpicking is available at as low as $0.7¢ per word with a minimum fee of $35.

*Current turn-around time is approximately three weeks.*

### Line editing

The most complete level of editing is line editing, which tackles issues within the text itself. This level is designed to help improve the flow of your writing and hunt down inconsistencies in the plot or theme, as well as offering suggestions with word-choice without taking away from your personal style. This also includes everything under copy editing, such as spelling and grammar. At this level, you can expect to pay as low as 1.7¢ per word with a minimum fee of $50.

*Current turn-around time is approximately four weeks.*
