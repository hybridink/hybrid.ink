title: End of year sale!
---

Well, that's it! 2018 is all wrapped up! Or, well, nearly so. We still have a few more hours to go, over here in Washington.

It was a good year for us. We started up on January 2nd of this year (after all, we couldn't file our formation documents on a holiday!) and immediately picked up Jen Durbent's [My Dinner with Andrea](/my-dinner-with-andrea), a wonderful book of love, hate, and growth. Shortly thereafter, we fell in love with John Minichillo's [The Last Workshop](/the-last-workshop) and its themes of coming to terms --- or not --- with one's own competencies. Late in the year, Durbent returned with [canon](/canon), a wide-ranging collection of poetry.

To help celebrate these wonderful works, we're taking 10% off of [*everything* in our catalog](https://gumroad.com/hybridink)! The sale will last until the end of January 2nd, our founding day, so make sure to come check it out and pick up your favorites! See below for the links.

<p>The famous writer is dying.</p>

<p>At least that's the rumor.</p>

<p>When the famous writer's secretary contacted the students of the Deep South Writers' Workshop on the his behalf after years of silence, they suspected something was up.</p>

<p>Out of respect for their former mentor, several former students agreed to return to Mississippi for a reunion:</p>

<p>A final get-together for one last workshop.</p>

<p>Hybrid is pleased to announce the return of Jen Durbent with her collection of poems, canon! These twenty-two works range in style from haiku to epic and cover a broad range of emotions and topics. Durbent turns her sharp wit to gender, politics, drugs, and even the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>Faith has started dating again - with the blessing of her wife - to find someone to connect with. Andrea seems to be a good match in many ways. The world is a difficult place for two trans women dating, but when you take into account neo-Nazis, a rapist, and some overzealous cops, it can feel downright impossible.</p>
