# Forward-Looking: Sex

What will sex look like in the future?

What will change about physical interaction?

What new challenges will sexuality face a hundred years down the line? Five hundred? A thousand?

*Forward-Looking: Sex* is an anthology of transfuturistic science-fiction. The stories within will explore the way sex, intimacy, and kink may change over time, from the near future to far, on Earth or other planets, in humans or those from the stars.

How will society change?

How will we?
