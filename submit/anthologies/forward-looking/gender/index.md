# Forward-Looking: Gender

What will gender look like in the future?

What will change about transition?

What new challenges will face trans folk a hundred years down the line? Five hundred? A thousand?

*Forward-Looking: Gender* is an anthology of transfuturistic science-fiction. The stories within will explore the way gender, transition, and trans issues may change over time, from the near future to far, on Earth or other planets, in humans or those from the stars.

How will society change?

How will we?

## About the anthology

*Forward-Looking: Gender* is an anthology of short fiction edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and E-Book formats, and will be available to download for Kickstarter backers.

Submissions are not yet open, pending completion of the Kickstarter campaign, but here is what {{site.brand}} will be looking for:

Submission content
:   We are looking for short story submissions that explore the shape of gender and identity in the decades and centuries to come. There is no restriction on gender of characters or perceived orientation.
    {% include nope.html %}

Submission length
:   5,000--15,000 words --- if you feel like you will fall outside this range, let us know!

Payment
:   $0.06 per word --- however, the kickstarter has stretch goals which will increase this rate.

Simultaneous submissions
:   No.

Multiple submissions:
:   Yes --- limit 2.

Submission rating
:   G--R --- we ask that authors avoid explicit descriptions of sex, but do understand that sometimes that's necessary to the plot. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask!

How to submit
:   *Submissions are not yet open.*{: class="closed" } Keep an eye out here for when they do!

<!-- :   Please email submissions, one per email, to [hybrid+flgender@hybrid.ink](mailto:hybrid+flgender@hybrid.ink). Please format the subject line of your email `[FLGender Submission]: <submission title> - <your name>` and attach your story to the email. In the body of your email, include a cover-letter with a brief synopsis as well as some information about yourself.

    Submission file formats accepted are DOC, DOCX, ODT, RTF, Markdown/TeX/plaintext, or, worst case, PDF. Stories will be gently massaged into an internal manuscript format, so if your work involves special formatting, let us know in your cover letter.

    Submission reading will be anonymous. Please remove the title and byline from your story, including any identifying information in the headers/footers. Name your submission file `FLGender--<your title>`. -->

Schedule
:   Submissions will be read and responded to within four weeks (but likely faster). From there, submissions will go through a brief editing phase, which will determine final wordcount, whereupon contracts and payment will be sent to the authors.

    The anthology will be available for sale within six months of decisions, barring any disasters.
