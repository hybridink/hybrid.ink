    publisher_intro: |
        _Hybrid Ink_ is pleased to announce our inaugural publication of the novel *My Dinner with Andrea* by Jen Durbent, a story of love, hate, and, occasionally, tacos.
    synopsis: |
        Faith has started dating again - with the blessing of her wife - to find someone to connect with. Andrea seems to be a good match in many ways. The world is a difficult place for two trans women dating, but when you take into account neo-Nazis, a rapist, and some overzealous cops, it can feel downright impossible.
    back_cover: |
        I got a story for you about two women falling in love, of Andrea and Faith. That seems nice, doesn't it? A nice trans lesbian queer romance?

        Oh, and there's Faith's wife, Michelle, too.

        And transphobia and ablism. And overzealous cops, Nazis, and a rapist.

        Oh, but there's also video games, polyamory, and living visibly trans in a small American town. And tacos.

        Dear reader, I got a story for you.

                This is a riveting, intense novel that goes right for the throat. It is definitely not an easy read, and while it has a central romantic storyline and a fairly hopeful ending, and therefore is technically a romance, it didn’t *feel* like a genre romance to me. Instead, it felt more like trans literary fiction, thematically and style-wise. It ripped me open, and I am still reeling from reading it, a week later, as I’m writing this review.

                It was a great experience to read a normal work of fiction from the unique perspective of a trans woman. It was refreshing!

                I found *My Dinner with Andrea* to be stunning. I see a lot of Faith in myself, and a lot of Andrea in who I want to be. It's an engaging and intimate work, and I'm proud to have it as the inaugural publication for _Hybrid Ink_.

                [*My Dinner with Andrea*] feels very personal, especially with the narrator's engagement. Very enjoyable!

    publisher_intro: |
        Hybrid is honored to announce our second publication, John Minichillo’s The Last Workshop. The famous writer is dying — maybe — and this smart, funny, and sharp novel follows the alumni of the Deep South Writers’ Workshop as they struggle to internalize the end of the writer’s career.
    synopsis: |
        Lydia, the famous writer's secretary, begins getting in touch with all his former students at the Deep South Writers' Workshop. Immediately, rumors fly (helped, in no small part, by Lydia herself). Is he sick? Is he dying? He's probably dying. They begin to organize a reunion.

        When the famous writer *does* die, it's a surprise to all, and the reunion becomes a memorial.

        A memorial, and one final workshop.
    back_cover: |
        At least that's the rumor.

        When the famous writer's secretary contacted the students of the Deep South Writers' Workshop on the his behalf after years of silence, they suspected something was up.

        Out of respect for their former mentor, several former students agreed to return to Mississippi for a reunion:

        A final get-together for one last workshop.

        Our words are the words of Adam, and he
        named all things, and that makes him a kind
        of god.

        Eden is our creation-right. Together, we will smash
        the flaming swords that guard its entrance;
        we will pass through the valley. We’ll eat fruits
        and taunt the serpents and claim what is our own.
