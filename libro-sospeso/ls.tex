Wikipedia has this to say about caff\`{e} sospeso:

\begin{quote}
  A \emph{caff\`{e} sospeso} or \emph{pending coffee} is a cup of coffee paid for in advance as an anonymous act of charity. The tradition began in the working-class caf√©s of Naples, where someone who had experienced good luck would order a sospeso, paying the price of two coffees but receiving and consuming only one. A poor person enquiring later whether there was a sospeso available would then be served a coffee for free.
\end{quote}

Buying a coffee for those who can't afford it or just out of kindness --- some coffee drive-thrus will let you pay for the person behind you --- but such acts of charity ought not be limited to just coffee! After all, one of the best gifts to give is a book.

Thus \emph{libro suspeso!} Pending books are those which have been purchased by folks who felt the need to pass on the gift of a good book. Perhaps they read \emph{\href{https://hybrid.ink/my-dinner-with-andrea/}{My Dinner with Andrea}} and loved it, and think someone else might love it to. You can purchase the \emph{libro sospeso,} and someone else who's interested will be able to pick a copy up for free! It's a good way to help out both other readers \emph{and} authors.
