# Small Loves: A Queer Microfiction Anthology

## About the anthology

*Small Loves: A Queer Microfiction Anthology* is an anthology of micro- and flash-fiction edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and eBook formats.

Here is what {{site.brand}} will be looking for:

Submission content
:   We are looking for micro- and flash-fiction submissions that explore queer  and minority identities. There is no restriction on the gender, expression, orientation, relationship configuration, or ace/aro spectrum of the characters, but the stories should focus on those topics. There is no restriction on genre.

    The topics in this anthology will be particularly useful to teens and young adults. While your stories needn't contain characters of that age range, keep in mind that we will be attempting to reach the audience who will benefit most from hearing stories with which they identify. As such, we will be particularly wary of tragedies, though please do not let that stop you from submitting. While stories about coming out are particularly important to such a demographic, please don't hesitate to also focus on day to day life, transition, relationships, and so on.

    Poetry will also be welcome, but understand that, with the anthology focusing on fiction, slots will be limited.

    Additionally, we will be looking for black-and-white art to complete the anthology, with the goal of at least one image per story. A separate call will be made for this down the line.
