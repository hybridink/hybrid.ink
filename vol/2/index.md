title: Hybrid vol. 2
---

Here are the issues for **Hybrid**{: class="brand" } vol. 2 (2018):

* No. 1 - Creations *coming soon* - Creators and Creations.  What drives us as furries to create what we do, at the rate we do, and at the prices we charge?  What drives commissions, trends, and styles?  How does our participation in furry color the creator-creation relationship?.
* No. 2 - Time *coming soon* - Past and Future.  Where did furry come from, and where is it going?  How fast are we moving, and how much are we staying the same?  Are our drives conservative or liberal, or if they're a mix, why is that the case?
