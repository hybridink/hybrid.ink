\paragraph{Artist's rights}

The Artist retains all rights to the Piece not granted to the Publisher below.

\paragraph{Publisher's rights}

The Author grants to the Publisher first North American English language print and electronic publication rights to the Work, exclusive for one year.

The Artist grants rights to use the Piece as \WorkType\ to be published in conjunction with the Work in print and digital formats, and to be used in marketing and publication.

\paragraph{Breakdown of rights}

The Publisher also retains the right to sell the e-book independent of services such as a file download.
    \item Exclusive for one year means that the Publisher requests exclusive rights to publication for one year, after which the publication rights will revert to non-exclusive, allowing the Author to seek subsequent publication elsewhere.

\paragraph{Other contracts}

\end{itemize}

The Artist indemnifies and holds harmless the Publisher against any and all claims, actions, demands, etc. arising from the publication of the Piece. This includes, but is not limited to, actions involving plagiarism, fraud, and theft.
