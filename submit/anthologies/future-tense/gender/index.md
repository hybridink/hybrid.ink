# Future//Tense: Gender

What will gender look like in the future?

What will change about transition?

What new challenges will face trans folk a hundred years down the line? Five hundred? A thousand?

*Future//Tense: Gender* is an anthology of transfuturistic science-fiction. The stories within will explore the way gender, transition, and trans issues may change over time, from the near future to far, on Earth or other planets, in humans or those from the stars.

How will society change?

How will we?

Here is what {{site.brand}} will be looking for:

Submission content
:   We are looking for short story submissions that explore the shape of gender and identity in the decades and centuries to come. There is no restriction on gender of characters or perceived orientation. We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

Submission rating
:   G--R --- we ask that authors avoid explicit descriptions of sex, but do understand that sometimes that's necessary to the plot. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask!

Genre
:   So long as the story takes place in the future and meets the other content requirements, anything goes. Shifters? Sure! Post-apocalyptic? Go ahead! Furries or aliens? Of course!

Submission length
:   5,000--15,000 words --- if you feel like you will fall outside this range, let us know!

Payment
:   $25 flat rate per story.

Simultaneous submissions
:   Yes.

Multiple submissions:
:   Yes --- limit 2.

Prior publication:
:   Yes, but preference given to stories that have not yet been published.

    * Submissions will **open** on January 1, 2020.
    * Submissions will **close** on April 1, 2020.
