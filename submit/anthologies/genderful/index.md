# Genderful

As furries, we base large swaths of our identity around species. We search for what fits, we let our species choose us, and find ways to be happy as such.

Species isn't the only portion of identity that we explore within this subculture, though; given the relative safety of our community, gender is also something that we frequently explore. More than 8% of furries describe themselves as non-cisgender, and a further 6% describe their gender as 'complicated'[^ref1].

Furry is often a means of wish-fulfillment for us, the players of our characters and the bearers of our avatars, so we often present ourselves as we desire to be seen. Within a fictional furry world, though, there's little reason to expect that similar statistics around gender identity and expression would not also be the case.

*Genderful: Green and Gold* --- How would those in a such a world explore their gender in a day-to-day context? What are the mechanics of hormone replacement therapy - transdermal patches obviously being out of the question - or of gender affirming surgery? What are the social implications of gender transition in a society already differentiated by species?

*Genderful: Blue and Silver* --- How would those in a such a world explore their gender in a sexual context? What are the effects of hormone replacement therapy or of gender affirming surgery on one's sexuality? How does sex and sexuality work in a setting with complex scents and sensitive noses? Dating, already scary, gains a new layer of tension; romance, already complex, gains a new layer of difficulty; and sex, already fraught with gender, becomes even more complicated.

## About the anthology

*Genderful* is an anthology of short fiction in two parts edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and e-book formats, as well as, depending on interest, audiobook format.

*Genderful: Green and Gold* is the general side of the anthology, and *Genderful: Blue and Silver* is the adult side. Stories for general audience and adult stories will be offered in separate sections or books (the exact details will be determined when we receive submissions) to allow readers to curate their experience.

Here's what we're looking for:

Theme
:   Stories should focus on characters struggling or living with a non-cisgender identity. There are no further restrictions on genre. No preference will be given to stories with any character:

    * on any stage of their chosen path of transition,
    * of any gender identity or gender assigned at birth, or
    * of any orientation

    We would like a balance of expressions, and will be publishing an anonymous list of what is represented in each submission as they come in!

Submission content
:   We are looking for short story submissions that explore the implications of non-cisgender life within the context of furry. There is no restriction on gender of characters or perceived orientation, including anywhere on the asexuality spectrum. Though the set and setting may be tough and the plot may involve hardships, the characters should be treated with sensitivity and care. We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

Submission rating
:   G-X --- stories of an erotic or violent nature and stories written for a general audience will be presented in separate **sections/books**[^ref2] to allow readers to curate their experience.

Genre
:   While there is no restriction on genre of submitted stories, we will aim for a cohesive anthology after the fact. For instance, if we receive more speculative fiction stories than contemporary fiction, that may play a role in accepting stories. Literary fiction, speculative fiction, murder mystery...give us your best!

Word count
:   5,000-10,000 words --- if you feel like your story will fall outside this range, let us know!

Payment
:   $25 flat rate per story.

Simultaneous submissions
:   Yes.

Multiple submissions:
:   Yes.

Prior publication:
:   Yes, but preference given to stories that have not yet been published.

Schedule
:  
    * Submissions will **open** on December 1, 2019.
    * Submissions will **close** on March 1, 2020.
    * Submissions will be read and responded to within four weeks (but likely faster). At this point, accepted submissions will receive contracts.
    * The anthology will be available for sale within six months of decisions, barring any disasters. Submission contracts will include a sunset clause.
