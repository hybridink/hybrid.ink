# Future//Tense: Love

What will love look like in the future?

What will change about relationships?

What new challenges will face us --- single folks and those in relationships of all shapes --- a hundred years down the line? Five hundred? A thousand?

*Future//Tense: Love* is an anthology of transfuturistic science-fiction. The stories within will explore the way love, relationship, and identity issues may change over time, from the near future to far, on Earth or other planets, in humans or those from the stars.

How will society change?

How will we?

Here is what {{site.brand}} will be looking for:

Submission content
:   We are looking for short story submissions that explore the shape of sex and love in the decades and centuries to come. There is no restriction on gender of characters or perceived orientation, including anywhere on the asexuality/aromanticism spectrum. We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

Submission rating
:   G--R --- we ask that authors avoid explicit descriptions of sex, but do understand that sometimes that's necessary to the plot. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask!

Genre
:   So long as the story takes place in the future and meets the other content requirements, anything goes. Shifters? Sure! Post-apocalyptic? Go ahead! Furries or aliens? Of course!

Submission length
:   5,000--15,000 words --- if you feel like your story will fall outside this range, let us know!

Payment
:   $25 flat rate per story.

Simultaneous submissions
:   Yes.

Multiple submissions:
:   Yes --- limit 2.

Prior publication:
