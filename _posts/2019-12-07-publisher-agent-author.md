Earlier today, the ever-delightful Linday Ellis came out with a video about her process of selling a book (which we're eager to read!) that shed some light on what goes into the process of selling a book to a larger publisher.

While I'll outline it very briefly below, it's well worth watching the video in full to hear Linday's take on the process:

In short, it boils down to the following set of steps:

1. Write your book
2. Query agents
3. Get represented
4. Polish your book
5. Pitch to publishers
6. Send out excerpts to those who request them
7. Send out manuscripts to those who request them
8. Get accepted and published

There's been a lot written on the publication process for larger houses. It helps, of course, that the industry has long since settled into a sort of standard procedure over time, the better to streamline the process across both a wide variety of fiction publishers and fiction writers.

The benefit to larger houses is that it is easier for a publisher to treat a book as an investment. After all, they have to put the money into the author's advance and the marketing of the product, but they also have the market share required in order to turn a profit on such an investment. Their role, then, is to both shape and follow market forces in order to maximize profit.

It's not a *bad* system. After all, a lot of great writing has come out of The Big Five. They have teams of people working to read the market and help pull together a shifting portfolio of the best stuff they can get their hands on.

However, that does leave a lot of works unpublished. As Lindsay says, while some of those works may be great writing, they may just...not be marketable at the time.

The alternatives listed in the video are to go with a smaller press, to go with an independent press, to go with self-publishing, or to trunk your novel. All of these have their ups and downs, of course, but as an independent publisher, I'd like to tackle the role we play.

Beyond simply being the second-choice folks you turn to when you don't want to trunk your less-marketable store, independent publishers serve an important role of being able to accept and sell material aimed for a narrower market.

For instance, we have decided to focus our efforts primarily on publishing LGBTQIA+ fiction. We have an interest and some expertise in the area, and are willing to take on projects that would not appeal to a wider market as long as they fit within that niche. In fact, in many cases, we might be delighted specifically in stuff that does not appeal to a wider market. Publishing for a smaller market, whether it be queer readers or furries or what may mean that your profits and comparative reach are diminished, but it also means that your readers will better appreciate what you do put out.

Larger publishing houses do a lot of really great work. They do their best to find the best work they can to get in front of readers who would really enjoy it. Independent publishers also have a role to play, however, and we'll always do our best to do the same within our narrower purview.
