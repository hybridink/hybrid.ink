# Fiction Submissions

{{site.brand}} has no restrictions on genre, but here are some of the things we enjoy:

* Experienced identity
* Psychological struggles
* Coming of age stories
* Inventive writing styles and techniques
* New takes on humanity: past, present, and future

Please don't let this list stop you, but here are some things we're wary of:

* Gore, body horror, etc.
* Slapstick
* Alternate histories
* Post-apocalyptic worlds
