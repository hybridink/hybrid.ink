Here are the issues for {{site.brand}} vol. 1 (2017):

* No. 1 - Identities *coming soon* - Gender and Sexuality, Identity and Interest.  It's one thing to list *what* you are interested in, but it's another altogether to explore why.  How does furry play into your gender identity and sexual orientation?  How does it influence how you view yourself and the things that you enjoy?
* No. 2 - Origins *coming soon* - Why are you a furry?  Why are others furries?  Where do we come from?  Reflections on what elements of socialisation led us to become the subculture that we are today.
