# Forward-Looking: Love

What will love look like in the future?

What will change about relationships?

What new challenges will face us --- single folks and those in relationships of all shapes --- a hundred years down the line? Five hundred? A thousand?

*Forward-Looking: Love* is an anthology of transfuturistic science-fiction. The stories within will explore the way love, relationship, and identity issues may change over time, from the near future to far, on Earth or other planets, in humans or those from the stars.

How will society change?

How will we?

## About the anthology

Here is what {{site.brand}} will be looking for:

Submission content

Submission length
:   5,000--15,000 words --- if you feel like your story will fall outside this range, let us know!

Genre
:   So long as the story takes place in the future and meets the other content requirements, anything goes. Shifters? Sure! Post-apocalyptic? Go ahead! Furries or aliens? Of course!

Payment
:   $25 flat rate per story.

Simultaneous submissions
:   Yes.

Multiple submissions:
:   Yes --- limit 2.

Prior publication:
:   Yes, but preference given to stories that have not yet been published.

Submission rating
:   G--R --- we ask that authors avoid explicit descriptions of sex, but do understand that sometimes that's necessary to the plot. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to ask!

Schedule
:  
    * Submissions will **open** on March 1, 2019.
    * Submissions will **close** on July 1, 2020.
    * Submissions will be read and responded to within four weeks (but likely faster). At this point, accepted submissions will receive contracts.
    * The anthology will be available for sale within six months of decisions, barring any disasters. Submission contracts will include a sunset clause.
