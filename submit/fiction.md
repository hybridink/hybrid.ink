# Fiction Submissions

{{site.brand}} has no restrictions on genre, but here are some of the things we enjoy:

* Experienced identity
* Psychological struggles
* Coming of age stories
* Inventive writing styles and techniques
* New takes on humanity

Don't let this list stop you, but here are some things we're wary of:

* Gore, body horror, etc.
* Slapstick
* Alternate histories
* Post-apocalyptic worlds

And finally, here is a list of things we will not accept presented in a positive light:

* Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of discrimination
* Pedophilia or sex with characters under the age of 18
* Rape, torture, dubious consent, forced seduction
* Snuff or Necrophilia

If you have any doubts about your content and these lists, please don't hesitate to ask!
