    title: "Small Loves: A Queer Microfiction Anthology"
    description: |-
        Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it's also a unique constraint for writers. How do you get an idea through in as few words as possible? How do you express a mood in 2,000 words? How do you build a character in the space of a tweet or two? It's a challenge, and with the popularity of microfiction on social media and other flash fiction challenges, one that many seem willing to take up!

        Inspired by Blue Neustifter's delightful story "Ghost", *Small Loves* will collect the best LGBTQ+ micro- and flash-fiction that writers have to offer.
    about: |-
        *Small Loves: A Queer Microfiction Anthology* is an anthology of micro- and flash-fiction edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and eBook formats.
    content: |-
        We are looking for micro- and flash-fiction submissions that explore queer  and minority identities. There is no restriction on the gender, expression, orientation, relationship configuration, or ace/aro spectrum of the characters, but the stories should focus on those topics. There is no restriction on genre. We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

        The topics in this anthology will be particularly useful to teens and young adults. While your stories needn't contain characters of that age range, keep in mind that we will be attempting to reach the audience who will benefit most from hearing stories with which they identify. As such, we will be particularly wary of tragedies, though please do not let that stop you from submitting. While stories about coming out are particularly important to such a demographic, please don't hesitate to also focus on day to day life, transition, relationships, and so on.

        Poetry will also be welcome, but understand that, with the anthology focusing on fiction, slots will be limited.

        Additionally, we will be looking for black-and-white art to complete the anthology, with the goal of at least one image per story. A separate call will be made for this down the line.
    genre: |-
        While there is no restriction on genre of submitted stories, we will aim for a cohesive anthology after the fact. For instance, if we receive more speculative fiction stories than contemporary fiction, that may play a role in accepting stories. Literary fiction, speculative fiction, shifters, furries...give us your best!

acethetic:
    title: "Acethetic"
    description: |-
        Much of our art, be it written, visual, or otherwise, is based around sexual attraction and the desire for sexuality. Even in stories where the major plot is focused elsewhere, sexuality will often show up in a subplot.

        Sexuality is hardly universal, however: though allosexuality may define the media landscape we live in, it does not define all of us!

        This anthology is a place for ace characters to shine. Perhaps your character is striving for recognition against expectations placed on them by society. Perhaps they are simply trying to live a quiet life and meeting unexpected resistance. Either way, *Acethetic* exists for their stories to be heard.
    about: |-
        *Acethetic* is an anthology of short fiction edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and e-book formats, as well as, depending on interest, audiobook format.
    content: |-
        We are looking for short story submissions that explore the lives of our asexual friends and family. The stories should focus on characters anywhere on the specturm of asexuality. Aromantic characters also welcome, of course! We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

genderful:
    title: Genderful
    description: |-
        As furries, we base large swaths of our identity around species. We search for what fits, we let our species choose us, and find ways to be happy as such.

        Species isn't the only portion of identity that we explore within this subculture, though; given the relative safety of our community, gender is also something that we frequently explore. More than 8% of furries describe themselves as non-cisgender, and a further 6% describe their gender as 'complicated' (via the 2016 Furry Survey).

        Furry is often a means of wish-fulfillment for us, the players of our characters and the bearers of our avatars, so we often present ourselves as we desire to be seen. Within a fictional furry world, though, there's little reason to expect that similar statistics around gender identity and expression would not also be the case.

        *Genderful: Green and Gold* --- How would those in a such a world explore their gender in a day-to-day context? What are the mechanics of hormone replacement therapy - transdermal patches obviously being out of the question - or of gender affirming surgery? What are the social implications of gender transition in a society already differentiated by species?

        *Genderful: Blue and Silver* --- How would those in a such a world explore their gender in a sexual context? What are the effects of hormone replacement therapy or of gender affirming surgery on one's sexuality? How does sex and sexuality work in a setting with complex scents and sensitive noses? Dating, already scary, gains a new layer of tension; romance, already complex, gains a new layer of difficulty; and sex, already fraught with gender, becomes even more complicated.
    about: |-
        *Genderful* is an anthology of short fiction in two parts edited by Madison Scott-Clary. It will comprise several pieces from diverse authors. The anthology will be released in both physical and e-book formats, as well as, depending on interest, audiobook format.

        *Genderful: Green and Gold* is the general side of the anthology, and *Genderful: Blue and Silver* is the adult side. Stories for general audience and adult stories will be offered in separate sections or books (the exact details will be determined when we receive submissions) to allow readers to curate their experience.
    content: |-
        We are looking for short story submissions that explore the implications of non-cisgender life within the context of furry. There is no restriction on gender of characters or perceived orientation, including anywhere on the asexuality spectrum. Though the set and setting may be tough and the plot may involve hardships, the characters should be treated with sensitivity and care. We are particularly keen on featuring #OwnVoices authors.

        Stories should focus on characters struggling or living with a non-cisgender identity. There are no further restrictions on genre. No preference will be given to stories with any character:

        * on any stage of their chosen path of transition,
        * of any gender identity or gender assigned at birth, or
        * of any orientation

        We would like a balance of expressions, and will be publishing an anonymous list of what is represented in each submission as they come in!
