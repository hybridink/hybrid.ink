# Forward-Looking: Gender

What will gender look like in the future?

What will change about transition?

What new challenges will face trans folk a hundred years down the line? Five hundred? A thousand?

*Forward-Looking: Gender* is an anthology of transfuturistic science-fiction. The stories within will explore the way gender, transition, and trans issues may change over time, from the near future to far, on Earth or other planets, in humans or those from the stars.

How will society change?

How will we?

    * Submissions will **open** on March 1, 2019.
    * Submissions will **close** on July 1, 2020.
