The Furry Experience is a themed, (bi-)annual non-fiction publication focusing on exploring the furry subculture through a diverse range of articles, opinions, and personal stories, lightened with a dash of poetry.  The goal of the review is to provide a sophisticated, intellectual look at the furry subculture through the eyes of those most deeply involved.  Articles should be well researched and opinions should be backed up by fact to provide an intelligent discourse on what it means to be a furry.
