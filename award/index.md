title: The <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> Award
---

<div class="announcement">
    This is a proof-of-concept for a non-fiction award. The format, the process, and whether or not <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> winds up running this award are to be finalized.
</div>

For many years, non-fiction played a relatively small part within the furry community. There would be an article here or there that someone would write and post somewhere, but the focus of many members of the subculture was on creative works of fiction. Art, both written and visual, focused primarily on the furry characters themselves.

This made sense, too, as the characters were the reason why so many of the members joined the community. However, as time has gone on and the subculture has grown more and more complex and variegated in the ways in which we interact with it, so too have the number of non-fiction words exploring the hows and whys.

To this end, The <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> Award for Excellence in Furry Non-fiction --- or simply The <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> Award --- was created to recognized and elevate works of importance within our subculture.

Below are the categories in which the award is given. For more details, please see the [rules page](/award/rules).

## Withdrawals

Any creator may opt out of being considered for an award for any of their creations. Additionally, any creator may withdraw any of their works from consideration on an individual basis.  Any withdrawals are noted below:

*No withdrawals noted.*

[^signups]: Signing up to a website as a requirement to view a nomination doesn't count as a restriction; by this we mean only members of a group or organization are allowed to access the resource.

[^wordcount]: This is flexible, and the distinction between article and book is more a matter of the scope of content: an article (usually) explores a single facet of a single topic, whereas a book is far broader in scope, and may cover several related topics.

[^platforms]:  This means the bit that does revolve around furry: yes, YouTube is a platform, but Culturally F'ed is the channel that is eligible). For a better example, an issue of <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> is eligible as a book (anthology type), an article in that issue is eligible as an article, but <span class="brand">Hybrid</span> is eligible as a platform, publisher, or channel.
