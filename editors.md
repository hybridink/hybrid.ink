Madison is a writer, editor, and software developer. After studying music composition at Colorado State University, she began working in open source software, spending her free time working with stories. She writes fiction and poetry, as well as investigative non-fiction, focusing primarily the furry subculture, and began {{ site.brand }} as a means to help promote literature that delves into the meaning of the world around us. As a transgender woman, she is keenly focused on promoting and advancing LGBTQIA+ writing.

She lives in the Pacific Northwest with her two dogs, a very soft cat, and her husband. You can find her writing at [makyo.ink](https://makyo.ink).
