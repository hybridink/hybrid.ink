{{site.brand}} is pleased to introduce a new way of sharing all of your favorite books with not just your friends, but the people around you! [*Libri sospesi*](/libro-sospeso) are **free** copies of our books which have been purchased by others as a means of sharing them with a wider audience. If you enjoyed a book or just want to spread the joy of reading and are able, you may purchase a copy of any of our books, which will then create a coupon for a free copy available to someone who maybe can't afford the book.

For now, we're offering this just for e-books until we get all of the details ironed out. If you'd like to give it a go, head to the [*libro sospeso* catalog](/libro-sospeso), where you can purchase pending books for others or see if any pending books are available. Also, keep an eye on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hybrid_ink) and [Mastodon](https://writing.exchange/@hybrid) accounts for announcements of free books!
