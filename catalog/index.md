## *Libro sospeso* catalog

Wikipedia has this to say about caffè sospeso:

> A *caffè sospeso* or *pending coffee* is a cup of coffee paid for in advance as an anonymous act of charity. The tradition began in the working-class cafés of Naples, where someone who had experienced good luck would order a sospeso, paying the price of two coffees but receiving and consuming only one. A poor person enquiring later whether there was a sospeso available would then be served a coffee for free.

Buying a coffee for those who can't afford it or just out of kindness --- some coffee drive-thrus will let you pay for the person behind you --- but such acts of charity ought not be limited to just coffee! After all, one of the best gifts to give is a book.

Thus *libro suspeso!* Pending books are those which have been purchased by folks who felt the need to pass on the gift of a good book. Perhaps they read [My Dinner with Andrea](https://hybrid.ink/my-dinner-with-andrea/) and loved it, and think someone else might love it to. You can purchase the *libro sospeso,* and someone else who's interested will be able to pick a copy up for free! It's a good way to help out both other readers *and* authors.
