{{site.company}} was started on January 1, 2018 after accepting Jen Durbent's [*My Dinner With Andrea*](/my-dinner-with-andrea) as our first publication, one written, proof-read, edited, published, and illustrated by transgender and nonbinary folks from start to finish. Since then, we have been committed to publishing thoughtful fiction, exploratory poetry, and creative non-fiction, with a focus on LGBTQIA+ authors and stories.

We try not to focus on "genre" or "literary" fiction, and avoid the distinction as much as possible. We welcome speculative fiction right alongside contemporary fiction, and will as readily accept furries, shifters, fantasy races, and aliens alongside human characters, so long as the stories touch us.

We are governed by a [code of conduct](/conduct) and share our thoughts on [what we will and won't publish](/nope). We believe that the work belongs first and foremost to the author and limit our [contracts](/contracts) accordingly.

{{site.brand}} acknowledges that we are headquartered on unceded Indigenous land belonging to Coast Salish peoples. We seek to support the varied strategies that Indigenous peoples are using to protect their land and their communities, and we commit to dedicating time and resources to working in solidarity. We acknowledge that we, as people living and working on these lands, are accountable to the laws and protocols of the people who have cared for this land since time immemorial. It is our intention to continue learning how to honour this responsibility.
